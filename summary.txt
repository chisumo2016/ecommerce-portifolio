Middleware and How to restrict access and actions in laravel
  Middleware - control the specific  to access
      localhost/product/create   we can restrict some access
          http- kernel
          call handle method - authenticated the user
           public function __construct()
               {
                   $this->middleware('auth')->only(['index', 'show']);
               }

                public function __construct()
                   {
                       $this->middleware('auth')->except(['index', 'show']);
                   }


Using Implicit Model Binding In Laravel
   inject to me or bind to this method of an instance of any model
   Done automatically
   Route::get('products/{product}','ProductController@show')->name('products.show');
   Route::get('products/{product:title}','ProductController@show')->name('products.show');
   public  function show(Product  $product)


Resource Routes in Laravel
 -Handle specific model
 -Route::Resource();
 -Plular
 -Nama


 Form Request  to validate Data
   Form request  in a single class
    php artisan make:request  ProductRequest
    return true
    withvalidator
    $product = Product::create($request->all());   better way is -which validate the input
    $product = Product::create($request->validate());

 Using Artisan to create Multiple Components at Once
   Make sure you follow the order based on foreign key
   order table must be existed before you create payment table
   user table must be existed before you create order table

   ORDER TO CREATE
   user
   product
   image
   cart
   order
   payment

php artisan make:model --help
php artisan make:model  Image -a

Layouts and components  with laravel blade
  -show the link to handle the product in layouts app
  -show the list of product in main/welcome view
  -Introduce the component in blade by creating a components folder and extends to blade


  Indicating the Columns of the tables in the migrations
     $table->timestamp('admin_since')->nullable();

     Implementing the Additional Model
       Mass Assigements to each model
       PHP Carbon

Implemented the Factories to the Models
 - use faker
 - Image belongs to product and user
 - save for product
 - save for user
 -factory(App\Cart::class)->create();  $instance = App\Cart::factory()->create();
 -factory(App\Payment::class)->create();  $instance = App\Cart::factory()->create();
 -factory(App\Image::class)->create();   $instance = App\Cart::factory()->user()->create();

ONE TO ONE RELATIONSHIP MODEL / TABLE

PAYMENT - ORDER  Payment belongs to an order
  $table->bigInteger('order_id')->unsigned();

  example

        Schema::create('payments', function (Blueprint $table) {
            $table->id();
            $table->float('amount')->unsigned();
            $table->timestamp('payed_at')->nullable();
            $table->bigInteger('order_id')->unsigned();
            $table->timestamps();

            $table->foreign('order_id')->references('id')->on('orders');
        });

        Model Payment

      public  function  order()
         {
             return $this->belongsTo(Order::class);
         }

        public  function  payment()
          {
              return $this->hasOne(Payment::class);
          }

          remember to add mass assigment

          $payment = factory(App\Payment::class)->make(); will not store in database

          >>> $payment = factory(App\Payment::class)->create();
          Illuminate/Database/QueryException with message 'SQLSTATE[HY000]: General error: 1364 Field 'order_id' doesn't have a default value (SQL: insert into `payments` (`amount`, `payed_at`, `updated_at`, `created_at`) values (344.77, 2020-09-08 05:06:04, 2020-11-12 13:03:06, 2020-11-12 13:03:06))'
          This because of foreign key

          We need to create an order first then payment to be able to persist data in the database

         >>> $order = factory(App\Order::class)->create();
         => App\Order {#4041
              status: "paid",
              updated_at: "2020-11-12 13:09:34",
              created_at: "2020-11-12 13:09:34",
              id: 1,
            }

         $payment = factory(App\Payment::class)->create(['order_id'=> 1]); but the better way

          $payment = App\Payment::create(['amount'=>200 , 'payed_at'=>now(), 'order_id'=>2]);

         App\Payment::all();

         using the relationship
         $payment = $order->payment()->save(factory(App\Payment::class)->make());

         Find the Order via relationship

         $order = App\Order::find(1);

         To obtained the Payment through relationship
         $order->payment;

          $order->payment()->get();  query builder

          Inverse
       >>> $payment = App\Payment::find(2);
          >$payment->order;

    ONE TO MANY RELATIONSHIP ELOQUENT
      -Order and User
      -An order must belongs to user  bse of that Order has the foreign key
      -User can have multiple Order
      example
       Schema::create('orders', function (Blueprint $table) {
                   $table->id();
                   $table->string('status')->default('pending');
                   $table->bigInteger('user_id')->unsigned();
                   $table->timestamps();

                   $table->foreign('customer_id')->references('id')->on('users');
               });
   order
    public function  user()
       {
           return $this->belongsTo(User::class, 'customer_id');
       }

   user

   public  function  orders()
   {
      return $this->hasMany(Order::class, 'customer_id') ;
   }

   Tinker to create a user
     $user = factory(App\User::class)->create();

  Let associate the user with an order

  >>> $user->orders()->save(factory(App\Order::class)->make());

  Search the user with ID 1
   $user = App\User::find(1);

   BE CAREFUL
 >>> $user->orders();
 => Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany {#4034}

USE  - COLLECTION OF ORDERS
$user->orders;
$order = $user->orders()->first();

>>> $user = factory(App\User::class)->create();

 the order-product migration , one can manage all
 -change the name of migration to productables  and it should in plural
 -change the name of the tables productables
 -Cardinality is very important


 Order Model
  return $this->morphToMany(Product::class, 'productable')->withPivot('quantity');
 Cart Model
 return $this->morphToMany(Product::class, 'productable')->withPivot('quantity');
 Product Model
  return $this->morphedByMany(Cart::class, 'productable')->withPivot('quantity'); //carts()
  return $this->morphedByMany(Cart::class, 'productable')->withPivot('quantity'); //orders()
 -Because product belongs to cart and order - m-m  laravel cannot figured out
 -use morphedByMany

 Tinker many - many
  Order and product

  - create user inorder to create an order
     >>> $user = factory(App\User::class)->create();
     => App\User {#4042
          name: "Alberta Cremin Sr.",
          email: "stoltenberg.kailee@example.org",
          email_verified_at: "2020-11-13 10:40:14",
          admin_since: null,
          updated_at: "2020-11-13 10:40:14",
          created_at: "2020-11-13 10:40:14",
          id: 1,
        }
- create an order through relationship
  >>> $order = $user->orders()->save(factory(App\Order::class)->make());
  => App\Order {#4038
       status: "paid",
       customer_id: 1,
       updated_at: "2020-11-13 10:44:27",
       created_at: "2020-11-13 10:44:27",
       id: 1,
     }
  >>>

  -attach the product to this specific order
  $order->products()->attach([4 => ['quantity'=>7], 9 =>['quantity'=>3]]);

  - Get a product
  $order->products;

  >>> $order->products;
  => Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Collection {#4042
       all: [
         App\Product {#4007
           id: 4,

             productable_type: "App\Order",
             quantity: 7,
           },
         },


INSERTING SIMPLE MODEL VIA RELATIONSHIP USING DATABASE SEEDER
  -
  $products   = factory(Product::class, 50)->create();
          $users      = factory(User::class, 20)->create(); //$users = User::factory(20)->create();

          $orders     = factory(Order::class, 10) //$orders = Order::factory(10)
                      ->make()
                      ->each(function ($order) use ($users){
                          //associate oreder to one user
                          $order->customer_id  = $users->random()->id;
                          $order->save();

            //assocaite new payment - one payment with each

            $payment = factory(Payment::class)->make();     // $payment = Payment::factory()->make();
                  $order->payment()->save($payment);
                  //$payment->order_id  = $order->id;
                  //$payment->save();

  -To obtained the full list of user
     $users = App\User::all();
     $orders = App\Order::all();
    $payments = App\Payment::all();
    $order = App\Order::first();

    Obtain the payment through an order

 The legacy version of the Laravel Eloquent factories
   composer require laravel/legacy-factories


ELOQUENT SCOPES TO IMPROVE VISUALIZATION
-show the product if the status is available
-Scopes allow you to easily re-use query logic in your models
-Function to our model
-allow to apply some restriction,query logic  we can utilize to all project
-Two types of scopes
    logic
    local   https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/eloquent
    - within the controller  we can use the method available();
    -in the product model we can use ScopeAvailable($query)
    -If my boss ask me to change the available i can do eg 1


 Error : Image not showing via <
        img  class="card-img-top" src="{{ asset( $product->images->first()->path )}}" alt="" height="500">
 Solution :



USE NESTED RESOURCE IN LARAVEL TO  PRODUCT TO A CART
  -Add prooduct to cart , user will click the button on the product to be able to add into a cart
  -we need to build a form  to be able to add a cart
  -existing product to existing cart
  -Identify the cart
  -we going to use the resource nested controller class
  -parent must be present all the time
    php artisan make:controller ProductCartController --parent=Product --model=cart
    -store() method
    -destroy() method
  -create a set route must be in plural
     eg Route::Resource('products.carts','ProductCartController')->only(['store','destroy']);
-when the user click add to cart will be showing the quantity 1 ,2  etc for every single product
-Every product will have  quantity once click add to cart


LEARN OUR TO USE COOKIES TO RETRIEVE THE SHOPPING CART
  -To resolve the current cart the user may be able to use
  -if the cookie exist we can resolve otherwise will be creating a cart
  -If the user remove the cookies ,the cart will be lost
  -we get an id from the cookie
  -Use Facades cookie
  -we need to return the cookie in the resources
  -attach ,
     sync  adding the new element and removing  , syncWithoutDetaching

USE DEPENDENCY INJECTION IN LARAVEL TO DISPLAY THE  PRODUCTS OF A CARTS
  -User as to have the way to view the cart
  -Dependecy injection
  -link to show the cart in app layouts
  - routes of carts in web route only index
  -create a cartControler  and resolve the cart from the cookie
  -instead of copying the getFromCookieOrCreate and paste to cart controller
  -we can create a service provider in app, allow to resolve
     App\Service\CartService.php
- - we can remove  getFromCookieOrCreate()  and paste into service file
  -we can use the service we created to our controller
  - we going to use the dependency Injection in ProductController
  -create a carts index
  -obtain the product from the carts
     show the cart is empty and if not show the product
     https://ecommerce-portifolio.test/carts
 -SERVICE HELP US NOT REPEAT THE CODE .



 TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SERVICE TO REMOVE THE CART PRODUCTS WITH LARAVEL
 -remove the cart from cookie in cartproduct controller
 -let add if condition in the product cart components
 -create a form  to remove the cart from products
 -Put and else
 -resolve the cookie
 creating the cookie should be responsibility of cart service
 -we just remove the relationship (pivot table) in the cart and not product itself


USING LARAVEL COLLECTIONS AND USE IT TO INJECT THE CART COUNTER IN BLADE
 -Cart link - show the counter
 -app layout  @inject('cartService, 'App\Services\CartService') to every single view
 - use inject method from laravel, laravel throw blade
 -use collection in the cart
   https://laravel.com/docs/8.x/collections
     sum and plunk
-change the method from the cartController to be getfromcookie()
- we need to add the condition in the cart index
    ! isset($cart)
- Application -cookies- delete from there


ORDER

RECALL SOME LARAVEL FEATURE TO CONFIRM AND INITIATE AN  ORDER
- Press cart to make order
-link in cart
    <a  class=" btn btn-sucess mb-3" href="{{ route('orders.create') }}">Start Order</a>
- create two methods create and store
-To send the products which are currently in the carts not in the order
-we obtained cart from the cookie
-Show order details
-->total = product * quantity via pivot table
-problem of showing an images


LEARN ACCESSORS IN LARAVEL AND USE IT TO CALCULATE TOTALS

-Through the cart and products via collections
 -GET /ASSESSOR
 Accessors and mutators allow you to format Eloquent attribute values when you retrieve or set them on model instances.
 -done in model directly and call the method in the view
 -adding every products into the cart via plunk in car model
 - we can do in the order model as we did  in product
 -Cart ->index.php  <h4 class="text-center">Your Cart Total:  <strong>{{   $cart->total}}</strong></h4>
 -in component we're going to show the quantity of product in the cart and total of specific product
   <p class="card-text">{{ $product->pivot->quantity }}<strong>{{ $product->total}} </strong></p>


   IDENTIFY AUTHENTICATED USERS AND CREATE AN ORRDER
   -Take the products in the cart and attach to new order which we're going to created
   -Once the user has confirmed
   -How? To create a button the  order create view
   -Will send the post request in the order create view blade
   -Store in Order Controller and customer_id in order moderl is an instance of the user
   -Identify the user via session
   -Middleware to authenticate the user
   -Store and create need an authenticated user
   -Once the user click start -> need an authenticate user inorder to procede the order
   -STORE controller we can ge the user
      $user =  $request->user();
              dd($user);
   -we know is the user we want then we can order
   -obtain cart from the cookie
   -obtain the products via collection via map()
   -function will receive every single produce
   -attach the key to a specific order via mapKeys
   -to turn the collection to array



   USE A LARAVEL NESTED RESOURCE CONTROLLER TO CHARGE FOR AN ORDER
   -associate and create payment to an order
   -insert the payment to specific order
   -nested controller
     php artisan make:controller OrderPaymentController --parent=Order --model=Payment
   -create a payment view
   -Display the grand total via order
   -User click Pay Button ,will go on store message
   -remove the element from the cart once the payment is successful via cartService and inject the middlware auth
